# Sudoku Solver

This is a web-based Sudoku Solver. It's written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Sudoku solving algorithm is implemented using a Backtracking approach. **The Sudoku Solver is hosted and can be accessed [here](https://sudoku.vrnchndk.in).**

> _Backtracking is an algorithmic strategy that builds incremental solutions to a problem and abandons a solution as soon as it determines that the solution cannot be possibly extended to solve the problem. In the context of a Sudoku Solver, it starts filling in empty cells with numbers 1-9 and, if it encounters a cell that can't be filled without violating Sudoku's rules, it backtracks to the previous cell, changes the number, and continues the process._

## Features

- Web-based Sudoku board where users can input their own Sudoku puzzles.
- "Solve" button that automatically fills in the solution to the current puzzle.
- "Clear" button to clear the board and input a new puzzle.
